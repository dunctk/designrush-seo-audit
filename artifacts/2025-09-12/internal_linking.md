### Navigational Links (What They Have) vs. Contextual Links (What’s Missing)
- Navigational Links (Good): the list at the bottom of a page acts like a mini‑sitemap. It tells Google, “from this SEO page, you can also get to these other pages.” This is good for crawlability.
- Contextual, In‑Body Links (Better & Missing Opportunity): a contextual link is placed within a descriptive paragraph, where the surrounding text (the context) gives a strong signal about the relevance of the linked page. This is what the spiderweb concept is truly about — creating a rich, interconnected narrative.
- Why this matters: Google places significantly more weight on a link that is editorially placed within a sentence than on one that appears in a simple list at the end of an article.

### Revised, More Precise Examples of What Is Missing
#### Main SEO Agency Hub Page (/agency/search-engine-optimization)
1) Linking to Related Service Hubs
- What they have: a link to “Content Marketing Companies” in a list at the bottom.
- What’s missing (the contextual link): in the paragraph that reads, “These agencies are adept at creating compelling, valuable content that resonates with your target audience…”, the phrase “compelling, valuable content” is the perfect place to embed a link directly to the /agency/content-marketing page.
- Why it’s critical: this contextual, editorial link tells Google that the concept of “compelling content” is directly related to the “Content Marketing” hub page — a much stronger endorsement than a list item.

2) Linking to Geo‑Specific Pages
- What they have: a link to “SEO in Madrid” at the very bottom.
- What’s missing (the contextual link): a dedicated paragraph within the main body that provides context for local search, for example:
  - Finding the Best Local SEO Partner
    “For businesses that rely on foot traffic, working with a local SEO company is essential. These firms specialize in Google Business Profile optimization and location‑specific keyword strategies. Whether you need an SEO agency in New York to dominate the city’s competitive market or a firm in Chicago with deep local knowledge, finding an expert in your area is key.”
- Why it’s critical: this weaves links into a user‑helpful narrative and provides rich context for search engines. It answers “near me” intent far more effectively than a single footer link.

# Narrative Summary
- Agency Directory is the growth engine: agency pages account for ~80% of tracked traffic, and the top 10 pages drive ≈32.5% of total organic volume. Lift mid‑tier service hubs and geo pages to reduce concentration risk while protecting top hubs.
- Commercial intent dominates but transactional is thin: commercial ~58% vs. transactional ~4–5%. The highest upside is in “company/agency near me” and high‑CPC service terms (e.g., PPC, SEO, web dev). Prioritize quick wins in 4–10 to reach top‑3.
- SERP features are leverage: heavy presence of PAA and Local Pack; AI Overview and Video also appear frequently. Add PAA‑oriented FAQs, LocalBusiness schema on geo pages, and short explainer videos on top hubs to capture these surfaces.

## Handpicked Quick‑Win Shortlist (Impact‑First)
- seo agency near me — pos 7, vol 12,100, CPC $19.76 → /agency/search-engine-optimization
- web development company — pos 7, vol 12,100, CPC $14.89 → /agency/web-development-companies
- ppc company — pos 8, vol 5,400, CPC $32.98 → /agency/paid-media-pay-per-click
- google ads agencies — pos 10, vol 390, CPC $33.78 → /agency/paid-media-pay-per-click/google-adwords
- web design agency — pos 7, vol 18,100, CPC $9.43 → /agency/website-design-development
- Optional (non‑core but high CPC): hr outsourcing — pos 6, vol 5,400, CPC $29.10 → /agency/hr-outsourcing

## Template‑Level Actions to Ship
- Service hubs: align Title/H1 with primary query + variants; add comparison (“agency vs freelancer”), price ranges, top FAQs; surface top agencies with exact/partial‑match anchors.
- Trends → hub funnels: for trends pages ranking in 4–5 (e.g., “app” queries), add above‑the‑fold CTA and 4–6 contextual internal links to the related service hub and key geos.
- Geo pages: add local proof points (clients, awards, testimonials), city‑specific FAQs, LocalBusiness schema; cross‑link up/down the geo hierarchy.

## Hypotheses & Tests
- PAA expansion lifts CTR: adding 3–5 Q&As to top hubs increases PAA presence and CTR on keywords already showing PAA. Measure top‑3 share and CTR on PAA‑bearing terms.
- Trend→Hub internal links move 1–2 positions: adding 4–6 contextual links from related trends pages to their service hubs improves “company” queries (4–10 → 1–3). Track rank deltas on the linked cluster.
- Short videos earn carousel/AI inclusion: 60–90s “what/why/cost” clips on top hubs increase Video carousel visibility and help AI Overview quoting. Track video presence and CTR deltas.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Decliners to triage: video (avg pos ~7.6) and mobile_app have notable declines; schedule content refreshes and add FAQs/videos. Maintain weekly watchlist for services with >5 declining keywords.
- Concentration risk: protect the biggest hubs (web_design, web_dev) with frequent refreshes and internal link maintenance; diversify wins via mid‑tier services and geo expansion.

## 3‑Week Sprint (One‑off Delivery)
- Week 1: implement FAQ blocks + titles/H1 refresh on top 10 hubs; add 4–6 contextual links from 10 related trends pages; ship LocalBusiness schema on 10 highest‑value city pages.
- Week 2: publish 8–10 short explainer videos on top hubs; targeted PR for 2 weak services; fix canonicals on overlapping trends/listings.
- Week 3: review gains; expand to next 10 quick wins; document playbooks and handoff.

## Internal Linking — Contextual vs. Navigational

### Navigational Links (What They Have) vs. Contextual Links (What’s Missing)
- Navigational Links (Good): the list at the bottom of a page acts like a mini‑sitemap. It tells Google, “from this SEO page, you can also get to these other pages.” This is good for crawlability.
- Contextual, In‑Body Links (Better & Missing Opportunity): a contextual link is placed within a descriptive paragraph, where the surrounding text (the context) gives a strong signal about the relevance of the linked page. This is what the spiderweb concept is truly about — creating a rich, interconnected narrative.
- Why this matters: Google places significantly more weight on a link that is editorially placed within a sentence than on one that appears in a simple list at the end of an article.

### Revised, More Precise Examples of What Is Missing
#### Main SEO Agency Hub Page (/agency/search-engine-optimization)
1) Linking to Related Service Hubs
- What they have: a link to “Content Marketing Companies” in a list at the bottom.
- What’s missing (the contextual link): in the paragraph that reads, “These agencies are adept at creating compelling, valuable content that resonates with your target audience…”, the phrase “compelling, valuable content” is the perfect place to embed a link directly to the /agency/content-marketing page.
- Why it’s critical: this contextual, editorial link tells Google that the concept of “compelling content” is directly related to the “Content Marketing” hub page — a much stronger endorsement than a list item.

2) Linking to Geo‑Specific Pages
- What they have: a link to “SEO in Madrid” at the very bottom.
- What’s missing (the contextual link): a dedicated paragraph within the main body that provides context for local search, for example:
  - Finding the Best Local SEO Partner
    “For businesses that rely on foot traffic, working with a local SEO company is essential. These firms specialize in Google Business Profile optimization and location‑specific keyword strategies. Whether you need an SEO agency in New York to dominate the city’s competitive market or a firm in Chicago with deep local knowledge, finding an expert in your area is key.”
- Why it’s critical: this weaves links into a user‑helpful narrative and provides rich context for search engines. It answers “near me” intent far more effectively than a single footer link.

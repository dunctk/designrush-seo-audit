Got it. Here’s Koray’s “show up in AI search” playbook, cross-checked against primary sources (Google docs/blogs, reputable studies/news) with notes on evidence strength.

1. No AI-Overviews magic tricks → follow core SEO
   Koray: “there’s no specific methodology just for AI Overviews/AI Mode.” Corroborated by Google’s own guidance: *no extra requirements or special schema; apply normal SEO best practices* (indexable text, internal links, page experience, structured data that matches visible text). ([LinkedIn][1])

2. Be the canonical source for the entity/topic
   Koray emphasizes entity-centric coverage. Google says structured data helps it understand page content *and* real-world entities; organization markup disambiguates your brand and can influence Knowledge Panels. Practically: define the entity, link out with `sameAs`, keep attributes consistent. ([Google for Developers][2])

3. Answer the whole question (cover sub-intents)
   Koray argues you need to satisfy all sub-intents so AI can summarize from you. Google explains AI features use *query fan-out* across subtopics and surface links that help people “dig deeper,” which favors comprehensive, well-structured coverage. ([Google for Developers][3])

4. “Information gain” (publish unique value, not summaries)
   Koray popularized this. Evidence: Google’s May 21, 2025 post tells creators to make *unique, non-commodity* content; separate Google patent work describes assigning an *information gain* score to pages (note: patents ≠ production guarantees, but they show direction). ([Google for Developers][4])

5. Align with consensus—then extend it safely
   Koray recommends reflecting the dominant, well-sourced view and adding novel, correct details. Google explicitly uses *consensus-based* techniques for featured snippets to avoid contradicting expert consensus on public-interest topics—an adjacent mechanism that signals how “consensus, then value-add” is rewarded. ([blog.google][5])

6. Structure for machines (clear headings, FAQs, tables, schema)
   Koray pushes extractable formatting. Google: keep important content in *textual form*, support with high-quality media, and ensure structured data follows guidelines (there’s no “AIO schema”). Independent research shows tables are strong substrates for QA/LLMs, supporting the “make it machine-parsable” angle. ([Google for Developers][3])

7. Comparisons win (X vs Y vs Z)
   Koray highlights side-by-side trade-offs. Google says *AI Mode* is particularly helpful for *complex comparisons*; industry data on “comparisons” as a robust intent class supports this content pattern. ([Google for Developers][3])

8. Prove expertise & identity (author/brand entity)
   Koray: strengthen the author/brand entity. Google’s E-E-A-T update and people-first content guidance emphasize demonstrating experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trust; pairing this with Organization/Person markup helps disambiguate who is speaking. ([Google for Developers][6])

9. Keep it technically accessible (crawlable, fast, well-linked)
   Koray ties semantics to accessibility. Google’s AI-features page lists practicals: allow crawling, make content easy to find with internal links, good page experience, indexable text, and correctly-scoped structured data. ([Google for Developers][3])

10. Publish consistently (for discovery/crawl—not a “rank” switch)
    Koray stresses consistency. Google doesn’t say “cadence ranks you,” but its docs show why freshness/discovery matter: large/frequently updated sites should manage crawl budget; reducing crawl rate results in *less frequent refreshes* of your pages. Treat cadence as a *crawl/discovery* lever, not a ranking hack. ([Google for Developers][7])

Reality check on traffic from AI results
Google claims visits from AI Overviews tend to be *higher-quality/engaged*; independent Pew analysis finds users click fewer traditional links when an AI summary appears—so optimize to *be cited and to convert the clicks you do get*. ([Google for Developers][4])

Bottom line (evidence-based synthesis)

* If your pages are *indexable, comprehensively answer multi-part intents, and add unique facts/insights*—and you *prove who you are* with clean entity signals—then you’re aligning with both Koray’s framework and Google’s published guidance for AI features. ([Google for Developers][3])
